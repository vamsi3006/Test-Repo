 <h1>  About Chris Spooner</h1>

 <p>
        The company began in 1911, founded in Endicott, New York, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) and was renamed "International Business Machines" in 1924.<br></br>
        IBM produces and sells computer hardware, middleware and software, and provides hosting and consulting services in areas ranging from mainframe computers to nanotechnology. <br></br>
        IBM is also a major research organization, holding the record for most U.S. patents generated by a business (as of 2019) for 26 consecutive years.[5]<br></br>
         Inventions by IBM include the automated teller machine (ATM), the floppy disk, the hard disk drive, the magnetic stripe card, the relational database,<br></br> the SQL programming language, the UPC barcode, and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). 
        The IBM mainframe, exemplified by the System/360, was the dominant computing platform during the 1960s and 1970s.
